# Elden Ring Automatic Checklist

This tool is made for **100% completion players**.

Elden Ring Automatic Checklist is an online tool created for the purpose of being able to know your missing items in Elden Ring.
Online there are already a plenty of checklists that can be filled out manually, but there are none that do it automatically, so I got the idea to create one.
If you like the project leave a star on Github repository.:heart:

### How it works

- The Elden Ring save is analyzed;
- The slot selected by user is separated;
- The inventory is read;
- All results are saved in a .json file;
- Json file is parsed and compared with a list of IDs;
- Two lists are derived, one containing items owned and the other containing items not owned;
- The two lists are used to generate the web page.;

## Features:

With this tool you can:

- View all owned **Weapons**, **Armor**, **Talisman**, **Spells**, **Ashes of War** and **Spirit Ashes**
- View all not owned **Weapons**, **Armor**, **Talisman**, **Spells**, **Ashes of War** and **Spirit Ashes**
- All items are **categorized by type**. For example, weapons are divided into daggers, straight swords, axes,...
- All items have a link that redirects directly to the [wiki page](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Elden+Ring+Wiki), with all the information about obtaining the item and various stats.

## Support

I planned to add some features:

- Make a section in which armors are divided according to their [armor set](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Armor)
- Add option to show missing [key items](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Items)
- Add option to show missing [bosses](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Bosses)
